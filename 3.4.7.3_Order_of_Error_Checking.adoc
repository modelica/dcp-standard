===== Order of Error Checking

The following tables (Table 107, Table 108, Table 109) define the order of the checks for PDUs a DCP slave must perform. If multiple checks fail, the action from the failed check with the lowest order value must be reported first. The error codes apply to the fields +error_code+ of +RSP_nack+ and +RSP_error_ack+.

NOTE: This does not necessarily apply to the order of internally performed checks. This order indicates the sequence of error reporting. This is independent of the sequence of actual performed checks.
