===== PDU STC_run
After receiving +STC_run+, the slave transitions immediately to state +SYNCHRONIZING+ or +RUNNING+, respectively.

The field time is used to schedule the start of a simulation run in HRT or SRT operating modes. It refers to absolute time.
If time >= current absolute time, a DCP slave must wait until the point in time arrives.
If time is less than the current absolute time (time < current absolute time) the DCP slave shall respond with +RSP_nack+, including +error_code = INVALID_START_TIME+.
If the value of time equals zero (“0”), simulation shall start immediately. In case of non-real time operation mode (NRT), time must be ignored, considering that the simulation run is controlled by +STC_do_step+.

+CONFIGURED+ -> +SYNCHRONIZING+
When time is reached, the slave starts to exchange data and the simulation time starts to advance.

+SYNCHRONIZING+ -> +RUNNING+
When time is reached, the actual simulation experiment must start.
