.Applicable PDU validity checks
[width="100%", cols="1,3", options="header" ]
|===
|Check
|Details

|Type identifier
|The type_id field of the received PDU is checked. All valid type identifiers are specified in section 3.3.

Note: This affects type_identifiers which are not specified, as well as PDUs which are not intended to be processed by this DCP slave, e.g. RSP_ack.

|Length
|The PDU length in bytes is checked.

Note: A plausibility check would include checking for PDU length smaller than 4 Bytes, resulting in an immediate drop. Detailed length checks shall be performed as defined in Table 107, Table 108, and Table 109.


|Support
|The received PDU is supported by the DCP slave, e.g. capability flag canSupportReset is set.

|Receiver
|The receiver field of the received PDU is evaluated against the assigned DCP slave id.
In state ALIVE, check if receiver is greater than zero.

Note: The DCP slave id zero is reserved for the master. Therefore no slave can be a valid receiver of a PDU which is determined for receiver zero.

|Sequence id
|The pdu_seq_id field of the received PDU is evaluated and checked for integrity. The maxConsecMissedPdus attribute from DCP slave description may influence the exact behavior.

|data_id/param_id
|The data_id or param_id field is validated.

|State
|The type_id field of the received PDU is validated against the current DCP slave state according to Table 63.

|Semantics
|All fields of the received PDU, that are specified in section 3.3 and are not explicitly covered in this section, shall be checked for validity and integrity.

.Applicable actions related to PDU validity checks
[width="100%", cols="1,3", options="header" ]
|===
|Activity
|Details

|Drop PDU
|The received PDU shall be dropped silently, without any further actions.

|Process PDU
|The received PDU shall be processed further according to this specification document.

|Handle error
|The occurred error shall be communicated to the DCP master. Possible actions include transition to an Error state, and responding an error_code by using RSP_nack or RSP_error_ack.
A list of corresponding error_codes can be found in section 3.4.7.3.
