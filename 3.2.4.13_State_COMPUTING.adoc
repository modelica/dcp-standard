.State COMPUTING
[width="100%", cols="2,5", float="center"]
|===
|General
|In this state one computational step is performed. The values from the most recent Data PDUs are used for internal computation. The virtual simulation time is incremented by the number of steps given in the field +steps+ of the PDU +STC_do_step+ multiplied by resolution.

  Note: This state applies to NRT (non-real-time) operating mode only.


|Preconditions
|The DCP slave is set to NRT operating mode.

|Allowed Actions
a|*	Exchange of DCP Control and Notification PDUs
* Report state
* Indicate end of computational step
