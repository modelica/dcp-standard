===== Available communication medium
In the following the procedure of error handling is described under the assumption that it is still possible to exchange PDUs.

|Sequence Number
|Action

|1
|A fault (faulty behavior or condition in model or RT system) occurs within a DCP slave (time tf). After the DCP slave detected this fault (time tfd) it transitions self-reliantly to the Error superstate. +
Note: The transition to +ERRORHANDLING+ is not requested from the master.

|2
|The DCP slave transitions to the +ERRORHANDLING+ state immediately.

|3
|Within the +ERRORHANDLING+ state, the DCP slave tries to send an +NTF_state_changed+ to the master. Then it starts suitable error handling routines and tries to resolve the error. +
Note: Appropriate measures of error resolving are shutdown of subsystems, potential energy dissipation in connected RT systems, etc. This may take some time.

|4a
|If successful, the DCP slave transitions to +ERRORRESOLVED+ state immediately.

Note: No request to do so from master.

The DCP slave either sends a PDU +NTF_state_changed+ to its master, reporting that the state transition is finished, or reports the state change to the master on request.

Note: As defined in communication pattern.

|4b
|If not successful, the system experiences an unrecoverable error. The transition to state +ERRORRESOLVED+ is not performed. Signal SIG_exit to shut down in terms of an error handling procedure may be called.

|5
|In state ERRORRESOLVED, the DCP slave receives a PDU +STC_reset+ (time tr). It acknowledges it by sending a PDU +RSP_ack+ to the DCP master.

|6
|The transition to state +CONFIGURATION+, of superstate Normal operation is performed. Either a PDU +NTF_state_changed+ is sent to the master or the state change is reported to the master on request.
