==== Data Type Conversions

A DCP slave shall be able to perform data type conversions for inputs and parameters as specified in Table 11. The character “x” indicates that the given conversion is allowed and feasible.
For inputs and tunable parameters, an invalid conversion shall be detected in state +CONFIGURATION+. In that case, an error code shall be sent as a response to PDU +CFG_input+ and PDU +CFG_tunable_parameter+.

NOTE: Empty cells are considered as invalid conversions.
