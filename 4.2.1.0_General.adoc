==== General
A DCP slave using IPv4-based transport protocols is accessible through an IP address and a port number. This information is defined within the DCP slave description. For communication with a DCP master, the DCP slave replies to the IP address and port where the initial +STC_register+ is coming from.

NOTE: A DCP master could be implemented as a IPv4-based client, whereas a DCP slave could be implemented as a IPv4-based server.

As soon as +STC_register+ is received and positively acknowledged (+RSP_ack+ sent by DCP slave and received by DCP master) the IP address and port for communication with the master are fixed for this simulation run.

The port information at the slave side is cleared, as soon as +STC_deregister+ is received.

NOTE: The DCP slave sender port may differ from the DCP slave receiving port.
