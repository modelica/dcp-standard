|Semantics

|Dependencies
|Element exists
|Dependency information shall be expressed.

|Dependencies
|Element does not exist
|No dependency information is expressed.

|Initialization
|Element exists
|In Initialization superstate, dependencies are specified. This output depends on the inputs and parameters referenced by a Dependency element.

If the Initialization element has no childs, no dependencies between this output and all inputs and parameters exist.

|Initialization
|Element does not exist
|In Initialization superstate, no dependencies are specified.
Note: In that case this output may depend on all inputs and parameters.

|Run
|Element exists
|In Run superstate, dependencies are specified.
This output depends on the inputs and parameters referenced by a Dependency element.

If the Run element has no childs, no dependencies between this output and all inputs and parameters exist.

|Run
|Element does not exist
|In Run superstate, no dependencies are specified.

Note: In that case this output may depend on all inputs and parameters.

|Dependency
|vr and dependencyKind given
|The described dependency between this output and the specified input or parameter vr exists with the specified dependencyKind.
