===== PDU RSP_state_ack
This PDU is used by a DCP master to report the current state in the field +state_id+. The sender field holds the +slave id+ of the slave. In case the slave is in state +ALIVE+ i.e. it has not been registered and thus has not been given a +slave+ id, the slave uses the DCP +slave+ id from the receiver field of PDU +INF_state+ to answer with the sender field of PDU +RSP_state_ack+.
