=== CAN Bus Communication Systems
This specification supports CAN bus communication systems. Due to the facts that

*	the CAN payload is limited to 8 bytes,
*	CAN does not support fragmentation,
*	CAN uses its own addressing schema (arbitration)
* and thus not all Control PDUs can be sent via CAN as defined in native DCP specification
the DCP specification for CAN bus is non-native. This specification of DCP over CAN supports the KCD file formatfootnote:[https://github.com/dschanoeh/Kayak]

In order to map the DCP onto the CAN bus, two additional resources are provided together with this specification:

*	DCP over CAN XSD schema description (DCP_over_CAN.xsd)
*	DCP over CAN XSL style sheet (DCP_over_CAN_to_KCD.xsl)
