===== Control PDU Sequence ID
To check the sequence identifier of a received Control PDU, the following criterion applies:

pdu_seq_id~last~ ~valid~ + 1 == pdu_seq_id~current~

The field +exp_seq_id+ in +RSP_nack+ shall always contain the last valid received +pdu_seq_id+ + 1.
If the PDU sequence ID check is violated, the error code +INVALID_SEQUENCE_ID+ applies.
