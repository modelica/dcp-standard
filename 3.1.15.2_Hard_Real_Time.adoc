===== Hard Real-Time (HRT)
All deadlines for all outputs must be met. Simulation time is synchronous to absolute time. In case of any deviations, the DCP slave transitions to the error state.

NOTE: Synchronous means that one unit of elapsed absolute time corresponds to the same unit of simulation time.
