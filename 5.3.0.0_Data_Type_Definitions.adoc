|Description

|xs:unsignedByte
|uint8
|unsignedByte is derived from unsignedShort by setting the value of maxInclusive to be 255. The base type of unsignedByte is unsignedShort.

|xs:unsignedShort
|uint16
|unsignedShort is derived from unsignedInt by setting the value of maxInclusive to be 65535. The base type of unsignedShort is unsignedInt.

|xs:unsignedInt
|uint32
|unsignedInt is derived from unsignedLong by setting the value of maxInclusive to be 4294967295. The base type of unsignedInt is unsignedLong.

|xs:unsignedLong
|uint64
|unsignedLong is derived from nonNegativeInteger by setting the value of maxInclusive to be 18446744073709551615. The base type of unsignedLong is nonNegativeInteger.

|xs:byte
|int8
|int is derived from long by setting the value of maxInclusive to be 2147483647 and minInclusive to be
-2147483648. The base type of int is long.

|xs:short
|int16
|short is derived from int by setting the value of maxInclusive to be 32767 and minInclusive to be -32768. The base type of short is int.

|xs:int
|int32
|int is derived from long by setting the value of maxInclusive to be 2147483647 and minInclusive to be
-2147483648. The base type of int is long.

|xs:long
|int64
|long is derived from integer by setting the value of maxInclusive to be 9223372036854775807 and minInclusive to be
-9223372036854775808. The base type of long is integer.

|xs:float
|float32
|float is patterned after the IEEE single-precision 32-bit floating point type (see IEEE 754-1985)

|xs:double

|xs:normalizedString
|string
|String without carriage return, line feed, and tab characters.

|xs:dateTime
|Implementation specific
|Date, time and time zone
Example: 2002-10-23T12:00:00Z

The first line of the DCP slave description must contain its encoding scheme. It is required that the encoding scheme is always UTF-8:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

The DCP schema files (*.xsd) are also stored in UTF-8.

NOTE: The definition of an encoding scheme is a prerequisite, in order for the XML file to contain letters outside of the 7 bit ANSI ASCII character set, such as German umlauts, or Asian characters.

The special values NAN, +INF, -INF for variables values are not allowed in the DCP XML files.

NOTE: Child elements, defined by sequence of elements in the DCP slave description, are ordered lists according to document order, whereas attribute information items are unordered sets (see http://www.w3.org/TR/XML-infoset/#infoitem.element).

The DCP slave description schema is based on ordered lists in a sequence and therefore parsing must preserve this order.
