==== Variables
All variable values (inputs, outputs, parameters, structural parameters) of a DCP slave are identified with a variable handle called _value reference_ (abbreviated vr). This handle is defined in the DCP slave description file as attribute +valueReference+ in element Variable. See section 5.13.2 for details.
