.State SYNCHRONIZING
[width="100%", cols="2,5", float="center"]
|===
|General
|For real-time operating modes SRT and HRT: The DCP slave is running and inputs/outputs are exchanged. Simulation time is mapped to absolute time.

For non-real-time operating mode (NRT): Simulation time is not advanced but can be increased by transitioning to the NRT-specific state +COMPUTING+. The DCP slave can receive inputs.

This state is used to account for initial transient oscillations.

|Preconditions
|None.

|Allowed Actions
|•	Exchange of DCP Control and Notification PDUs +
•	Sending and receiving of Data PDUs +
•	Report state +
•	Indicate end of sending
