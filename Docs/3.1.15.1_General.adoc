===== General
The DCP defines three different operating modes targeting the real-time properties specified in the following sections. A DCP slave must support at least one of them. Table 9 specifies the operating modes enumeration.

|===

The DCP slave is informed by the master about the chosen operating mode (one of HRT, SRT, NRT).

  Note: For native DCP (see section 3.1.21), this is achieved via STC_register PDU (see section 3.3.7.1).
