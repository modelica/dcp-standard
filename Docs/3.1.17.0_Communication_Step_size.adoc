==== Communication Step Size
The communication step size is defined as follows:

where numerator divided by +denominator+ represents the resolution and steps represents the integer number of resolution intervals. The minimum value for steps is 1.
If the communication step size for an output should be fixed, then both the attributes resolution and steps need to be set to fixed in the DCP slave description.

For operating modes HRT and SRT, steps is configured via PDU +CFG_steps+ (see section 3.3.7.15) by the DCP master in state +CONFIGURATION+.
For the operating mode NRT, steps is given in each PDU +STC_do_step+ (see section 3.3.7.7).
