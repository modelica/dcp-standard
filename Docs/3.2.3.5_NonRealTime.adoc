===== NonRealTime
The states +COMPUTING, COMPUTED+, and +SENDING_D+ belong to +superstate NonRealTime+.

The states of +NonRealTime+ are used for triggering calculation, advance of simulation time, and data exchange.

  Note: Consider 1 master and 2 slaves A and B, including slave-to-slave communication.
  Initially all slaves are in state RUNNING.
  The master sends PDU STC_do_step to both slaves.
  Slave A changes to state COMPUTING, calculates fast, moves on to COMPUTED.
  If no state SENDING_D would exist, he would immediately send its outputs to slave B and changes to state RUNNING.
  Slave B might receive this data before having received the STC_do_step from the master, due to network delay, latency, etc.
  Thus, he would calculate with input data not consistent to current simulation time instance. The state SENDING_D prevents this.
