==== Logging
The DCP supports the transmission of arbitrary log data from a DCP slave to its master. For that, it defines two different approaches, namely log on request (LoR) and log on notification (LoN).
For LoR, log messages are stored within the DCP slave. They are picked up by the master on request at any time. LoR supports the delivery of multiple log messages at one time.
For LoN, log messages are not stored within the DCP slave. They are transmitted to the master immediately. LoN supports the delivery of a single log message at one time.

The exact format of a log message is defined in the DCP slave description using log templates. A DCP slave only delivers argument values to fill into this template. The full log message is then generated by the master.

Note: The length of all PDUs exchanged for logging may be precalculated using the DCP slave description.
