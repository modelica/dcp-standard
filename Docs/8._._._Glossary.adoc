|Term
|Description

|DCP master
|A DCP master is defined as a black box, communicating by DCP PDUs over a given transport protocol, controlling at least one DCP slave.

|DCP slave
|A DCP slave is defined according to this specification, communicating by DCP PDUs over a given transport protocol, being controlled by exactly one DCP master.

|Distributed Co-Simulation Protocol (DCP)
|Communication protocol which enables distributed co-simulation.

|Distributed Co-Simulation Protocol Description
|Description of a DCP slave in XML file format with the file extension .dcpx according to this specification.

|Distributed Co-Simulation Protocol File
|A ZIP file having the extension .dcp designed to hold DCP description files.

|Distributed Co-simulation Scenario (DCS)
|A DCS is defined as the integration of multiple DCP slaves to perform a common simulation task.

|Error
|A DCP slave error is a discrepancy between a computed, observed or measured value or condition, and the true, specified or theoretically correct value or condition, that concerns violations of real time requirements or other DCP related functionality.

|Failure
|Termination of the ability of a DCP slave to perform as intended.

|Hard Real-Time
|Time-related criteria (deadlines) must be met at all times. Miss of a deadline is assumed to result in a total system failure.

|Non-real time simulation
|A simulation in which the simulation time is not synchronous to the absolute time.

|Protocol Data Unit (PDU)
|Information that is exchanged as a unit among DCP slaves.

|Real-time simulation
|A simulation in which the simulation time is synchronous to the absolute time.
