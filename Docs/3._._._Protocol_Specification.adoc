== Protocol Specification

=== Basic Definitions
The DCP is a platform-independent protocol which enables communication and data exchange for co-simulation, between a multitude of different computing platforms, operating systems and software. This section defines the data types supported by the DCP and their encodings to enable interoperability between these systems.

==== Keywords
Unless noted otherwise, the meaning of keywords (must, must not, should, â€¦) as stated in Appendix A of this document applies.

==== Version Descriptor
This DCP specification utilizes the following version descriptor numbering scheme. See also section 5.4.

*	+dcpMajorVersion+: First level version number. Indicates a major specification release that is relevant to compliant implementation.
*	+dcpMinorVersion+: Second level version number. Indicates a minor specification release that is relevant to compliant implementation.
*	+dcpMaintenanceVersion+: Third level version number. Indicates a specification release that is not relevant to compliant implementation.

==== DCP Slave
A DCP slave is either a simulation model or a real-time system on a ready-to-run execution platform that is accessible via DCP over a given supported communication medium.

==== DCP File
All static information related to a DCP slave is stored in an accompanying DCP file (file extension: .dcp). This file is a zip file. The compression method used for the zip file must be "+deflate+".
Any tool exporting or importing such a file must obey the following.


===== Exporter for DCP files version 1.0
Any tool creating DCP files according to this version of the specification. Its internal structure must be as follows.

.Internal structure of DCP file
[width="100%", cols="3,3", options="header" ]
|===

|Structure
|Description

|/
|Root of the zip file. +
_Note: It is not allowed to place any other files and folders at the same hierarchy level than the "v1.0" folder._


|/v1.0
|Folder in the root of the zip file. +
This is mandatory.

|/v1.0/dcpSlaveDescription.dcpx
|DCP slave description according to this specification. See sec-tion 5 for details. +
This is mandatory.


|/v1.0/documentation
|Directory containing documentation for the DCP slave. +
This is optional.


|/v1.0/*
|Other files and folders might be included. +
This is optional.
|===


===== Importer for DCP files version 1.0

An importing tool must only consider the folder "/v1.0" and its subfolders. Any other files and folders at the same hierarchy level than the "v1.0" folder must be ignored.

  Note: This is reserved for future versions of the DCP.
