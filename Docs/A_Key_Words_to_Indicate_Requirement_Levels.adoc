=== A. Key Words to Indicate Requirement Levels
The following definitions are taken from RFC 2119.

MUST: This word, or the terms "REQUIRED" or "SHALL", mean that the definition is an absolute requirement of the specification.

MUST NOT: This phrase, or the phrase "SHALL NOT", mean that the definition is an absolute pro-hibition of the specification.

SHOULD: This word, or the adjective "RECOMMENDED", mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a particular item, but the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course.

SHOULD NOT: This phrase, or the phrase "NOT RECOMMENDED" mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behavior described with this label.

MAY: This word, or the adjective "OPTIONAL", mean that an item is truly optional.  One vendor may choose to include the item because a particular marketplace requires it or because the ven-dor feels that it enhances the product while another vendor may omit the same item. An imple-mentation which does not include a particular option MUST be prepared to interoperate with an-other implementation which does include the option, though perhaps with reduced functionality. In the same vein an implementation which does include a particular option MUST be prepared to in-teroperate with another implementation which does not include the option (except, of course, for the feature the option provides.)

Guidance in the use of these Imperatives: Imperatives of the type defined in this memo must be used with care and sparingly. In particular, they MUST only be used where it is actually required for interoperation or to limit behavior which has potential for causing harm (e.g., limiting re-transmissions). For example, they must not be used to try to impose a particular method on im-plementors where the method is not required for interoperability.

Security Considerations: These terms are frequently used to specify behavior with security impli-cations.  The effects on security of not implementing a MUST or SHOULD, or doing something the specification says MUST NOT or SHOULD NOT be done may be very subtle. Document authors should take the time to elaborate the security implications of not following recommendations or requirements as most implementors will not have had the benefit of the experience and discus-sion that produced the specification.
