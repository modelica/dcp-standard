== 3 Protocol Specification
---
**3.1 Basic Definitions**

The DCP is a platform-independent protocol which enables communication and data exchange for co-simulation, between a multitude of different computing platforms, operating systems and software. This section defines the data types supported by the DCP and their encodings to enable interoperability between these systems.

**3.1.1 Keyword**
Unless noted otherwise, the meaning of keywords (must, must not, should, â€¦) as stated in Ap-pendix A of this document applies.

**3.1.2  Version Descriptor**
This DCP specification utilizes the following version descriptor numbering scheme. See also sec-tion 5.4.

*	dcpMajorVersion: First level version number. Indicates a major specification release that is relevant to compliant implementation.
*	dcpMinorVersion: Second level version number. Indicates a minor specification release that is relevant to compliant implementation.
*	dcpMaintenanceVersion: Third level version number. Indicates a specification release that is not relevant to compliant implementation.

**3.1.3 DCP Slave**

A DCP slave is either a simulation model or a real-time system on a ready-to-run execution plat-form that is accessible via DCP over a given supported communication medium.

**3.1.4 DCP File**

All static information related to a DCP slave is stored in an accompanying DCP file (file extension: .dcp). This file is a zip file. The compression method used for the zip file must be "deflate".
Any tool exporting or importing such a file must obey the following.

**Exporter for DCP files version 1.0**

Any tool creating DCP files according to this version of the specification. Its internal structure must be as follows.
