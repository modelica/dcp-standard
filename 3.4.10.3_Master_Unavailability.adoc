===== Master Unavailability

If the master becomes unavailable its slaves may detect this (e.g. heartbeat) and proceed to the error superstate, as described in section 3.4.10.2.

The master needs to ensure that the previously used scenario configuration can be reproduced, including the DCP slave ID. This may be ensured by e.g. assignment of DCP slave IDs based on sorted DCP slave UUIDs.
