|General
|At entry to this state coming from +CONFIGURING+, a start condition depending on parameters, but not on input values has been realized by the DCP slave.

The DCP slave is ready to initialize with other DCP slaves.

  Note: If node time synchronization is required (e.g. for HRT operating mode), it must have been done before leaving this state via PDU +STC_run+ because that PDU includes a time value.


|Preconditions

|Allowed Actions
a|*	Exchange of DCP Control and Notification PDUs
* Report state
* Receiving of Data PDUs
