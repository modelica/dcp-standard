Figure 24: IPv4 type definition
The UDP via IPv4 transport protocol allows separate configurations for different PDU families.

*	The optional Control element defines the host and port attributes intended for receiving PDUs of the Control PDU family.
*	The optional DAT_input_output element defines a host attribute, as well as an optional list of either port ranges, indicated by from and to attributes, or single ports, indicated by the port attribute. This is intended for receiving DAT_input_output PDUs.
*	The optional DAT_parameter element defines a host attribute, as well as an optional list of either port ranges, indicated by from and to attributes, or single ports, indicated by the port attribute. This is intended for receiving DAT_parameter PDUs.

These recurring attributes are specified in Table 167.
