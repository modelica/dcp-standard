=== B. Default DCP Slave Integration
The following Figure 34 sketches the procedure for default DCP slave integration using the native DCP specification. A DCP slave provider ships a DCP slave description in DCPX file format and a DCP slave to the DCP integrator. The DCP integrator uses the DCP slave description for configura-tion of a scenario. This scenario description is exported to a DCP master. The DCP master is an implementation being able to control DCP slaves. It generates a configuration for simulation and rolls out this configuration to the running instances of the DCP slaves. Then the scenario may be simulated.

NOTE: This specification covers the intended behavior of a DCP slave and the DCP slave description. This specification does not cover the import process of DCP slave descriptions, the generation of a valid scenario configuration, the scenario description being exported to the DCP master, the exact steps necessary for DCP slave instantiation, as well as DCP slave implementation details.
